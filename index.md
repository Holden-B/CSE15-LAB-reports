**2. Remote Connection**

Next, We will look at how to connect remotley to the UCSD servers. This requires a personal address. 

Within VSCode:
- open a new terminal, located at the top of the page under the terminal tab
- within the terminal type `ssh cs15lsp22XXX@ieng6.ucsd.edu`
- (the XXX will be your own personalized letters, different for everyone)
- Hit `return` and you will be prompted with `password`
