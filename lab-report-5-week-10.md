# Lab Report 5

> In this lab report we will be looking at the multitude of `markdown-parser` test files from lab 9
>
**Specifically we will look at:**
- Finding different test results
- comparing outputs with `CommonMark`
- describing what failed within the program


## Finding tests with different results
Due to the large amount of test files, using `vimdiff` was the most efficient way to observe differences between two implementations.
